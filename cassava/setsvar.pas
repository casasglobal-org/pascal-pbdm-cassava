Procedure Setsvar;
(*
Set limits on seasonal variation values for multi-season runs.
For example if Nseasonalvar = 75 that means that at the start of each
season the mean value of SoilN for the field will be set to the
initial SoilN  value from the setup file  +- 75%.

There may be further variation within the field during each season
since levels of SoilN in each part of the field grid will be set relative
to the SoilN chosen at the start of the season.

Insect immigrations: If a plant receives immigrants I call that an
immigration event.  There are variables controlling the probability of
an immigration event for each plant each day.  There are other variables
that control the number of adults in such an event.
(There will be an alternative to this method when we implement the source
of immigrants as the pool of former emigrants.  7/4/96)
